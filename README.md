# hw3

From the last hw so far all I've done is just expand the classes into separate .h and .cpp files 
It does the same think 
just do the make command and it should just print out what we had from last time
one thing that we have to do is implement JvTime instead of Time 
I haven't gotten rid of it cause I'm not sure where we were originally supposed to do it from HW2 

for this hw we're supposed to implement the bool function that is mentioned in the HW instructions
so far all I've done is just declare it in .h files for all the classes 
and like declared it in the cpp files still not sure how to implement it in the main file

currently rewacthing yesterday's lecture to be able to understand it 

when you download the repository the .o files don't have anything really they're just the executables made from the Makefile
