In this program when compiling the Makefile which now includes the 
ecs36b_JSON.cpp which will have funcitons that willl alow us to
convert the program into a .Json file with the myJSON2File and 
then we created Json::Value variable that called record_jv that will
be passed through the myFile2JSON in order to give the record_jv variable the JSON Valued from each record. 
We then call the myObject2JSON that will check each value of the JSON and see if it 
is it's correct data type and more specifically Object type.
